# Solar Paper

A theme for nvim inspired by the great
[vim-paper](https://github.com/yorickpeterse/vim-paper) and 
[grey](https://github.com/yorickpeterse/nvim-grey) by Yorick Peterse,
changing the main background and foreground colors to Solarized-inspired ones.

Other differences to the aforementioned themes:
- bold is not used, I find it too jarring in the terminal
- even less syntax highlighting in general, except for method and type definitions - kept
  as a structural hint when browsing code
